- In this project, we will create an application that allows users to manage favorite places using **Socket** and **UDP protocol**. 

- Information for a place includes: *code*, *place name*, *geographical location (latitude, longitude)*, *description* and *pictures*.

- A list of locations is stored on **the server** with the images. The server provides services so that the client can download a list of locations, view detailed information about a location, and able to download the location images.

- For more details, please read in <Report.pdf> file provided above.
